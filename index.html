        <h3>This is the story of Bob.</h3>
        <p>Bob used to live in the US. Bob used to take pride in being a true blooded American. He used to go out of his way to convince people that 'Murica was the greatest country in the world. Then Trump got elected. Naturally, Bob packed up his stuff and left. Bob decided to come to India. So, as mentioned before, this is story of Bob. And India. </p>

        <h3>Delhi</h3>
        <img src='' width='100%' />
        <p> Bob decided to settle in Delhi. Bob reasoned, "Delhi's the capital of India, it has to be nice, right?" (You can see where Bob went wrong with his reasoning). When he reached the airport, Bob decided to take the metro to his house near Connaught Place. Bob exited the metro at Rajiv Chowk around 8ish and looked around. By 8:30, Bob was back at T3. He had chosen foolishly.</p>

        <h3>Mumbai</h3>
        <p>Bob then decided to instead settle in Mumbai. Bob reasoned, "Mumbai sounds cool! All the actresses and Priyanka Chopra live there and I loved Quantico so..."(Quantico? We already don't like you Bob). Bob exited the plane and walked towards the exit of the airport, but fainted before he reached. Doctors claimed they'd never seen a man sweat so much so quickly. He got dehydrated(Get well soon, Bob). When he recovered, Bob went to his apartment and ordered some food because he was tired of the bland hospital food. Bob ordered Kolahpuri chicken because it sounded zesty. Needless to say, Bob ended up in the hospital again. Upon recovering, Bob proclaimed the city cursed and left again. He realized he had yet again chosen incorrectly.</p>

        <h3>Pune</h3>
        <p>Bob never made it out of the airport on Pune because he got chased off by members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh after they cornered him as soon as he left the airport. They put him to the dreaded, "Speak Marathi or go away" test. Bob failed. Bob was lucky he was near the airport so he escaped before they hit him and robbed him of all his money.</p>
