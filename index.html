        <h3>Root Indicative Ratio</h3>
        <p>What is root indicative ratio? It's the ratio of the square root of the passenger traffic through an airport for a financial year by the square root of amount of cargo processed by the same airport. Using which, we mean to shed some light on the relationship between the data of the airports and the nature of the city.  </p>

        <h3>Delhi-8.20</h3>
        <img src='' width='100%' />
        <p> Surprisingly enough Delhi has a relatively low ratio than expected. Despite being a very small city, the capital of India is the economic capital of the country as well and receives the most tonnage of Cargo with Gurgaon, the business hub being very close by to the airport. Hence Delhi airport receives both a large population of people due to its cultural and historical importance (resulting in massive tourism) and a large amount of cargo traffic as well.</p>

        <h3>Bombay-7.6</h3>
        <p>Similar to Delhi, Bombay, the entertainment, commerce and fashion hub of India, and the city with the highest GDP in India, receives both a large number of people and a huge amount of Cargo as well. Delhi airport, and the city Delhi as well being bigger than Bombay is one of the reasons for Bombay’s cargo and people received by the airport being lesser than that of Delhi. Having already established industries and being less popular of a tourist spot than Delhi, Bombay receives more Cargo and hence has a lower ratio than Delhi.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-4'>
        <h3>Bangalore-8.5</h3>
        <p>Bangalore is the “Silicon Valley of India”, being the hub of information technology companies in India it has much lesser cargo than Delhi or Bombay being received by the airport because of the nature of industries in Bangalore (Tech, IT don’t require huge physical equipment). The tourism and business in Bangalore (Large number of people working jobs in IT industries) results in a huge population of people being received at the airport, all these factors resulting in a higher ratio than Bombay as well as Delhi and a ratio closer to the mean.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-5'>
        <h3>Chennai- 7.1</h3>
        <p>Another business intensive city with more than one third of India’s automobile industry being based in Chennai resulting in a huge amount of cargo, much more than Bangalore being received by the airport (and hence resulting in the least ratio). Chennai is one of the best cities to live in India because of its safety in terms of health and pollution (The Quality of Living rated Chennai as the safest city in India) and being a relatively less popular tourist spot than Delhi and Bombay as well as having extremely hot weather throughout the year results in lesser (than Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore) people visiting.</p>

    <section id='part-6'>
        <h3>Kolkata-10.2</h3>
        <p>The cultural capital of India and the education hub of the Country, Kolkata has much lesser cargo coming in via air because it possesses the countries oldest operating port which brings in a lot of cargo at a more reasonable cost as well resulting in a much higher ratio despite the number of passengers being pretty high due to its cultural importance and business as well. </p>

    <section id='part-7'>
        <h3>Hyderabad-11.1</h3>
        <p>As we move away from the business intensive cities we arrive at Hyderabad, with most of its business based on the traditional manufacturing, the knowledge sector and huge tourism resulting in a much lesser cargo traffic and decent population traffic at the airport giving us a relatively higher ratio.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-8'>
        <h3>Kochi-10.5</h3>
        <p>Another major port city and commercial hub, major industries in Kochi include construction, ship building, manufacturing and export, resulting in a good amount of cargo traffic relative to population traffic resulting in a lower ratio than Hyderabad.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-9'>
        <h3>Ahmedabad-9.8</h3>
        <p>Dominated by the textile and gemstone (diamond) industry Ahmedabad has huge cargo traffic as well as population traffic due to it being a huge tourist attraction and business hub of Gujarat, resulting in a ratio very close to the mean.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-10'>
        <h3>Goa-41.3</h3>
        <p>The very evident huge deviation is due to the highly commercialized beaches in Goa resulting in it being transformed into a party destination for music festivals and becoming a major attraction for foreign tourists as well. We can see that the relative population traffic is huge and cargo traffic is minimal resulting in a skyrocketing ratio.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='part-11'>
        <h3>Pune-14</h3>
        <p>Pune is the education hub of India, also known as the “Oxford of the East” due to the presence of several well-known institutions which attract many foreigners as well, hence it is not as business intensive as the other metropolitan cities, resulting in relatively lesser cargo traffic and more population traffic due to the quality of living, education and tourism.</p>
